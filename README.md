# Bangla-Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

Fake news has become a widespread issue due to a variety of political and commercial reasons. It has a massive impact on the offline community, therefore there has been an increase in research focused on detecting fake news written in English and other languages. This project focuses on the detection of Bangla fake news from social media. I have experimented with five supervised machine learning algorithms which are Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, XG Boost and Gradient Boosting, utilizing Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency as feature extraction. Results show that KNN had an accuracy of 89.28%, Decision Tree Classifier 97.97%, Random Forest 99.49%, Gradient Boosting 96.43% and Extreme Gradient Boosting 99.30%.
